  ;; EZbake relies on this being stored top-level in the jar,
  ;; when including this project as an additional uberjar when building
  ;; pe-puppetserver. Lein 2.8.0 stopped adding project.clj at the top level.
  ;; Long term, it might be better to fix ezbake to handle the file's new location
  ;; under `META-INF/leiningen/group/artifact/project.clj`, but since this is the
  ;; only project that relies on that right now, it's simpler to just add it here.

  ;; For the jruby-deps uberjar builds, we want to exclude a few "common"
  ;; dependencies which we expect to be provided by other jars in the Java
  ;; classpath. We do this in order to make the dependency resolution
  ;; predictable regardless of the order in which the jars are referenced on the
  ;; classpath. Dependencies in the uberjar profile replace those from the base
  ;; project definition in order to exclude the unwanted dependencies from the
  ;; jruby-deps uberjar.
